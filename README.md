# SentimentAnalysis WebApp
Due to Webpages' various html contents, I only put codes to scrape reviews from Foursquare and Yelp to analyze.
You can play around with review pages from these websites.
Make sure URL format match to example one provided in the app.
Except from these two, this app would not be able to analyze others' contents.

> Used nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model from Huggingface for sentiment analysis.

> For Visual Analysis, Histogram and WordCloud are provided.
